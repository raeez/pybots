2010-10-25 23:44:21,971 - system - DEBUG - [#pcilevelonecompliant] patrick:	the topic should probably always have link to latest logfile also
2010-10-25 23:44:27,109 - system - DEBUG - [#pcilevelonecompliant] raeez:	yeah
2010-10-25 23:44:36,138 - system - DEBUG - [#pcilevelonecompliant] raeez:	more irc to implement, lol
2010-10-25 23:45:08,939 - system - DEBUG - [#pcilevelonecompliant] raeez:	hmm, yeah—the server serving the logfiles would be easy
2010-10-25 23:45:32,100 - system - DEBUG - [#pcilevelonecompliant] raeez:	just the access controls
2010-10-25 23:45:35,806 - system - DEBUG - [#pcilevelonecompliant] raeez:	are what I'm worried about
2010-10-25 23:45:45,463 - system - DEBUG - [#pcilevelonecompliant] raeez:	could pword it
2010-10-25 23:45:47,122 - system - DEBUG - [#pcilevelonecompliant] raeez:	or w/e
2010-10-25 23:45:49,977 - system - DEBUG - [#pcilevelonecompliant] raeez:	but want it fluid
2010-10-25 23:46:00,498 - system - DEBUG - [#pcilevelonecompliant] patrick:	nah
2010-10-25 23:46:01,265 - system - DEBUG - [#pcilevelonecompliant] raeez:	basically, what if you ask the logbots for the logs
2010-10-25 23:46:05,109 - system - DEBUG - [#pcilevelonecompliant] patrick:	actually no
2010-10-25 23:46:05,890 - system - DEBUG - [#pcilevelonecompliant] raeez:	and it makes a gist?
2010-10-25 23:46:09,962 - system - DEBUG - [#pcilevelonecompliant] patrick:	aaagh
2010-10-25 23:46:10,946 - system - DEBUG - [#pcilevelonecompliant] patrick:	security
2010-10-25 23:46:12,676 - system - DEBUG - [#pcilevelonecompliant] raeez:	and gives a link?
2010-10-25 23:46:14,512 - system - DEBUG - [#pcilevelonecompliant] raeez:	yeah, exactly
2010-10-25 23:46:19,960 - system - DEBUG - [#pcilevelonecompliant] patrick:	was going to say, put server on vpn
2010-10-25 23:46:22,624 - system - DEBUG - [#pcilevelonecompliant] patrick:	but that's also bad idea
2010-10-25 23:46:25,662 - system - DEBUG - [#pcilevelonecompliant] raeez:	yep
2010-10-25 23:46:30,949 - system - DEBUG - [#pcilevelonecompliant] raeez:	that's a really bad idea
2010-10-25 23:46:35,643 - system - DEBUG - [#pcilevelonecompliant] raeez:	hmmm, emails you the logs
2010-10-25 23:46:38,713 - system - DEBUG - [#pcilevelonecompliant] raeez:	when you ask for it
2010-10-25 23:46:41,673 - system - DEBUG - [#pcilevelonecompliant] raeez:	that's what I'll start with
2010-10-25 23:46:41,979 - system - DEBUG - [#pcilevelonecompliant] patrick:	just do basic HTTP auth
2010-10-25 23:46:49,355 - system - DEBUG - [#pcilevelonecompliant] patrick:	I think email's a pretty bad idea tbh
2010-10-25 23:46:54,574 - system - DEBUG - [#pcilevelonecompliant] patrick:	as in, sooo annoying for such a common use case
2010-10-25 23:47:12,385 - system - DEBUG - [#pcilevelonecompliant] raeez:	hmm, how often do you actually *need* the logs though?
2010-10-25 23:47:15,702 - system - DEBUG - [#pcilevelonecompliant] raeez:	will do, just curiosu
2010-10-25 23:47:17,881 - system - DEBUG - [#pcilevelonecompliant] patrick:	every day
2010-10-25 23:47:20,384 - system - DEBUG - [#pcilevelonecompliant] patrick:	for me
2010-10-25 23:47:25,085 - system - DEBUG - [#pcilevelonecompliant] patrick:	as in, *ideally* the IRC client woud support it
2010-10-25 23:47:27,329 - system - DEBUG - [#pcilevelonecompliant] raeez:	sure—I've never needed it
2010-10-25 23:47:29,437 - system - DEBUG - [#pcilevelonecompliant] raeez:	so, it does
2010-10-25 23:47:35,747 - system - DEBUG - [#pcilevelonecompliant] patrick:	I aaaaalways wish every IRC channel had logs
2010-10-25 23:47:43,121 - system - DEBUG - [#pcilevelonecompliant] patrick:	publicly accessible
2010-10-25 23:47:46,247 - system - DEBUG - [#pcilevelonecompliant] raeez:	linkinus has some cool logging stuff
2010-10-25 23:47:55,369 - system - DEBUG - [#pcilevelonecompliant] raeez:	but that obv. requires a machine
2010-10-25 23:47:57,178 - system - DEBUG - [#pcilevelonecompliant] raeez:	on all the time
2010-10-25 23:47:58,177 - system - DEBUG - [#pcilevelonecompliant] patrick:	oh, here's an idea -- a shared dropbox folder
2010-10-25 23:48:01,708 - system - DEBUG - [#pcilevelonecompliant] patrick:	that the logs are put in
2010-10-25 23:48:01,783 - system - DEBUG - [#pcilevelonecompliant] raeez:	hmmmmm yeah
2010-10-25 23:48:05,856 - system - DEBUG - [#pcilevelonecompliant] raeez:	can do that really easily
2010-10-25 23:48:05,987 - system - DEBUG - [#pcilevelonecompliant] patrick:	db now has an api
2010-10-25 23:48:17,032 - system - DEBUG - [#pcilevelonecompliant] raeez:	don't even need that—can just have it write the folder continuously
2010-10-25 23:48:19,416 - system - DEBUG - [#pcilevelonecompliant] patrick:	yeah sure
2010-10-25 23:48:22,511 - system - DEBUG - [#pcilevelonecompliant] raeez:	i.e. every n min.
2010-10-25 23:48:27,365 - system - DEBUG - [#pcilevelonecompliant] patrick:	yep
2010-10-25 23:48:31,977 - system - DEBUG - [#pcilevelonecompliant] patrick:	(or just literally continuously)
